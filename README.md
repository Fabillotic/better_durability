### IMPORTANT
This Resource Pack is for Minecraft Java Edition version 1.18.1.
Because of the nature of Minecraft core shaders this isn't compatible with other Shaderpacks.
It should work with normal Texture/Sound/... packs though.

### Installation
Download the newest release from this repository and move the zip file to your resourcepacks folder.
If the durability icons don't change, **Make sure that you set the guiScale in ```assets/minecraft/shaders/include/config.glsl``` to the GUI Scale from your video settings in Minecraft!**

**__Otherwise it won't detect it!__**

The default guiScale value is 2.
